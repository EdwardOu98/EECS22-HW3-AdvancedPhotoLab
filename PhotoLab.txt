This project is consisted of the old Photo Lab program and a few new DIP
filters. The codes are decomposed into different sections based on their 
functions. Include Guards are used in all header files. The interactive 
menu is expanded for the three new DIP filters. The new filters are:

1. Brightness: it changes the the brightness of an image by adding the 
   original color to a user input number which is between -255 and 255.
   If the user attempt to enter a number out of range, the program will
   prompt the user with an error message. 

2. HMirror: it horizontally mirrors an image through the following
   steps: 1)Find the center line of the image(in this program it is 300)
   2)Mirror the image by copy the color of one pixel to its symetric
   pixel. 

3. HueRotate: it applies the hue rotate effect to an image. The angle 
   is a user input with unit radian. 

All the filters, including the three filters from last program, will be
tested by running the auto test function. 

Besides the normal executable file PhotoLab, another executable file 
PhotoLabTest will be generated by the command lines in the Makefile.
